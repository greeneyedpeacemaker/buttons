            text-align: center;">Welcome to a World of Power</h1>
            <ol>If you hold a gun, and I hold a gun, we can talk about the law.</ol>
            <ol>If you hold a knife, and I hold a knife, we can talk about rules.</ol>
            <ol>If you come empty-handed, and I come empty-handed, we can talk about reason.
             But if you have a gun, and I only have a knife, then the truth lies in your hands.</ol>
              <ol>If you have a gun, and I have nothing, what you hold isn't just a weapon,
             it's my life.</ol>
               The concepts of law, rules, and morality only hold meaning when they are based
              on equality. The harsh truth of this world is that when money speaks, truth
             goes silent. And when power speaks, even money takes three steps back.
             Those who create the rules are often the first to break them.
             Rules are chains for the weak, tools for the strong.
            In this world, anything goes. 

            The only thing that matters is power.
            The only thing that matters is the ability to take what you want.
            The only thing that matters is the ability to make others obey your will.
            Experience is the Hardest teacher ever, because it gives the test first then the lesson afterwards
